# 3DFFL-Privacy-Preserving-Federated-Few-Shot-Learning-for-3D-Point-Clouds-in-Autonomous-Vehicles


This project presents a comprehensive framework for federated few-shot learning (3DFFL), focusing on 3D point cloud classification. The approach integrates Federated Learning (FL) with Few-Shot Learning (FSL) techniques, using PointNet++ for feature extraction and ProtoNet for classification. The framework ensures data privacy and leverages collaborative learning to handle data scarcity and heterogeneity.

## Key Features

- **PointNet++**: Advanced feature extraction from 3D point cloud data.
- **ProtoNet**: Few-shot learning classification network.
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed learning across multiple nodes, ensuring data privacy.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Enhances feature extraction for better performance.
- **Differential Privacy**: Ensures data privacy by adding noise to model parameters.
- **Mixup Data Augmentation**: Improves generalization and model robustness.
- **Momentum-Based Federated Averaging**: Accelerates convergence and improves model performance.
